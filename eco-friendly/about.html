                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>EcoPlate was born from a simple yet powerful idea: to transform waste into sustainable solutions. In 2018, our founders witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of plastic pollution on our oceans and the mounting waste from sugarcane production. This sparked a mission to create a product that could address both issues simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Through extensive research and collaboration with environmental scientists and material engineers, we developed our innovative biodegradable plates made from sugarcane bagasse. Today, EcoPlate stands at the forefront of the fight against plastic pollution, offering a sustainable alternative that doesn't compromise on quality or convenience.</p>
